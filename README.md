REST HTTP api to store and retrieve street addresses

Frameworks used:
Django 1.11.9
rest_framework 3.7.7
Requests

Main sources of information:

The parts not generated by the frameworks and made by me where the class in models.py serializations.py and views.py. Also some code added to urls.py to manage the addresses. Also all neccesary files to deploy on heroku.

The app is automatically deployed on heroku when is pushed but to deploy locally it is neccesary to have the frameworks described above and run the migrations. Also you need to create a db localy to host run the django models.
